## About me
I am a 15 year old living in California. I have a few hobbies like boxing and playing video games.



## Video Games
I love playing video games. I play video games on my computer, xbox, and even phone. It is crazy to see how far technology has come especially with things like cloud gaming. One of my personal favorite games would have to be fortnite battle royale
